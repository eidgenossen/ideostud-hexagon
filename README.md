# Description
A visual depiction of the connections between the Cognitive Sciences written in [TikZ](https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/PGF/TikZ) by [Olivia Guest](https://oliviaguest.com). This figure is derived from the original put forth by the Sloan Foundation in 1978 and reproduced from Figure 4 in Pléh and Gurova, 2013. Different versions of it over time have used ‘Artificial intelligence’ (as above) instead of ‘Computer Science’ and vice versa (cf. Miller, 2003).
